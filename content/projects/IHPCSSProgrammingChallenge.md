My code submission to the [IHPCSS](https://ss21.ihpcss.org/) 2021 Programming challenge. The code simulates heat diffusion in a metal plate over time.

The challenge was to process as many iterations as possible in the alotted 30 seconds, in other words, optimize the code using parallel programming paradigms.
